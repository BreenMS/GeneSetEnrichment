# Rapid gene set enrichment analysis across multiple user-defined gene lists
When performing gene-set enrichment analysis, one often wishes to compare gene set enrichment results across multiple user-defined gene lists. This may include gene lists defined by different combinations of user-defined cutoffs (P-values and fold changes) or multiple gene lists gathered from independent/related studies. 

Here I provide R statistical code (RapidGeneSet.R) to perform rapid geneset enrichment analysis across multiple user lists. 

1. Multiple genesets for gene enrichment analysis: GO:CC, GO:MF, GO:BP, KEGG Pathways, REACTOME pathways, CNS cell types, peripheral blood immune cell types, disease-gene relationships curated from DisGenNet (and those that are specific to brain/psychiatric phenotypes), lists of neurodevelopmental genetic risk loci.
2. . In addition, I provide methods to compare and contrast gene-set results across multipe lists.
