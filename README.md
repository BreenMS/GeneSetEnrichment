# Rapid Geneset enrichment testing across multiple user gene/protein lists. 
When performing gene-set enrichment analysis, one often wishes to compare gene set enrichment results across multiple specified gene lists. This may include gene lists defined by different combinations of user-defined cutoffs (P-values and fold changes) or multiple gene lists gathered from independent/related studies. Here I provide access to:

1. Multiple genesets for gene enrichment analysis: GO:CC, GO:MF, GO:BP, KEGG Pathways, REACTOME pathways, CNS cell types, peripheral blood immune cell types, disease-gene relationships curated from DisGenNet (and those that are specific to brain/psychiatric phenotypes), lists of neurodevelopmental genetic risk loci.
2. R statistical code to perform rapid geneset enrichment analysis across multiple user gene/protein lists. In addition, I provide methods to compare and contrast gene-set results across multipe lists.
